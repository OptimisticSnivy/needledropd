# To-do: 

- [ ]  Make album pages

- [ ]  Make Searchpage store, ie, let it maintain state (look for svelte page stores, page.url)

- [ ]  Look up SSR securing of API KEYS

- [ ]  Listen/Watchlist 

- [ ]  Profile 

- [ ]  Make it public 

- [ ]  Make a recommendations for more albums based of the backlog+favourite albums list, look up algorithms you can make out by yourselves, instead of looking for pre-existing solutions or libraries.

- [ ]  Tracklist + Tracklist rating?

# Ancillary to-do's:

- [ ]  The Album cover's gradient flows into albumcard and albumpage titles!

- [ ]  Published dates don't match release dates for older albums, becuase of Lastfm's API, fix them.

- [ ]  Dark | Light mode [colorscheme](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)
