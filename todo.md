# To-do:

- [ ] Make album pages

- [ ] Make Searchpage store, ie, let it maintain state (look for svelte page stores, page.url)

- [ ] Look up SSR securing of API KEYS

- [ ] Listen/Watchlist

- [ ] Profile

- [ ] Make it public

- [ ] Make a recommendations for more albums based of the backlog+favourite albums list, look up algorithms you can make out by yourselves, instead of looking for pre-existing solutions or libraries.

- [ ] Tracklist + Tracklist rating?

- [ ] Search-state could be refactored by svelte/store

- [ ] Auth on login page, fix w/ pocketbase.ts

- [ ] Draft reviews! (button in the modal, directly?)

# Ancillary to-do's:

- [ ] The Album cover's gradient flows into albumcard and albumpage titles!

- [ ] Published dates don't match release dates for older albums, becuase of Lastfm's API, fix them.

- [ ] Dark | Light mode [colorscheme](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)
